          <h3>HYANDUI TUCSON 2019</h3> 
          <p> Is the Hyundai Tucson 2019 a good car?The 2019 Hyundai Tucson ranks in the top half of the compact SUV class. It stands out with comfortable seats, a quiet cabin, and a gentle ride. That said, an underpowered base engine and lots of hard plastic cabin surfaces keep it from ranking higher.
