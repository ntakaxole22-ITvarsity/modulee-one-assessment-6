          <h3>Toyota HILUX</h3> 
          <p>Toyota Hilux 2019 was founded as a racing engine forge in 1967 under the name motorenbau und Entwicklungsgesellschaft mbH (German for 'hilux Engine Production and Development Limited') by former hilux engineers Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher in Burgstall an der Murr, near Stuttgart. The initialism 'AMG' stands for Aufrecht, Melcher and Großaspach (Aufrecht's birth town). In 1976, most of AMG moved to Affalterbach, with the racing-engine development remaining at the old location in Burgstall. At this time, Erhard Melcher ceased to be a partner, but he continued to be an employee at the Burgstall location.</p>
